## Data Description

The dataset consists of approximately 80 news headlines published between October 1-29, 2024, sourced from various media outlets including Gizmodo, CNET, Business Insider, MacRumors, and other technology and business news platforms.

## Project Objective

The primary aim of this project is to analyze market sentiment through news headlines, operating under the assumption that news headlines serve as a proxy for market sentiment and public perception. This approach is founded on the efficient market hypothesis, which suggests that market prices reflect all publicly available information. News headlines, being one of the most immediate and widely consumed forms of public information, potentially play a crucial role in shaping market participants' perceptions and decisions.

In addition to analyzing market sentiment, this project also aims to uncover distinct topics within the news headlines through topic modeling. Identifying key themes in financial news is essential for understanding the specific drivers of sentiment and for isolating different narratives that might influence market perceptions. By applying topic modeling, we can go beyond a broad sentiment score and instead categorize news into more granular topics such as product launches, financial performance, and promotions or deals.
